description: Use a stick blender (Bamix is best) to make this delicious Aioli effortlessly
---
## Ingredients
* 1 egg
* 2 tsp lemon juice (or more for extra lemony flavour)
* 1/2 tsb salt
* 1 crushed/minced medium garlic clove (or more for extra garlicy flavour)
* 1 cup Rice Bran Oil (or another oil with minimal flavour, Olive Oil tends to be too strongly flavoured)

## Directions
1. Put all ingredients in a large mug or glass - *one that will fit all the ingredients and the stick blender can reach all the way to the bottom without too much space around the sides.  
A pint glass works perfectly for this or a fairly large coffee mug.*
1. Give ingredients time to settle at the bottom with the oil on top.
1. Gently place the stick blender in and lower to the very bottom, then wait a few seconds to allow everything to settle again.
1. Turn on blender, starting at the bottom for a few seconds, then slowly raise it to the top to magically combine everything into a thick and creamy emulsion.
1. You may need to work it around the top to get all the last bits of oil that float on top

***Aioli will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks or until the expiry date on the eggs***

### Also try adding other flavourings:
* Mustard
* Spices
* Whatever you think will work
