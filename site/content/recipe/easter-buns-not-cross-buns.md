**\
Dough**\
Crumble **Edmonds Active Yeast** into a small bowl, add the first measure of **Edmonds Standard Grade Flour** and **Chelsea White Sugar**. Mix in the **Meadow Fresh Original Milk** which has been cooled to blood heat, cover and leave in warm place for 10 mins.

Sift the second measure of **Edmonds Standard Grade Flour**, salt, mixed spice and cinnamon into a large bowl; rub in the **Tararua Butter** and add the second measure of **Chelsea White Sugar** and sultanas.

Add the beaten egg to the sponged yeast mixture.  Add yeast/egg mixture into the flour mixture until a soft dough is formed. Knead until light and smooth and no longer sticky.

Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a clean cloth and allow to stand in a warm place until double in bulk (about 40 minutes).

Turn onto a lightly floured surface, punch down and knead dough until smooth and elastic. Divide dough into 16 even-sized pieces - knead each into a round shape. Place on a greased slide tray 1cm apart. Cover and stand in a warm place until well risen (about 10-15 minutes).
