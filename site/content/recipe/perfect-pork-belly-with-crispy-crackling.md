## DO NOT SCORE THE SKIN

## Directions

1. Dry the skin - ideally leave uncovered in fridge overnight
2. Flip it over and oil + season the meat (olive oil, salt, pepper, fennel powder)
3. Flip it back over so the skin is up, then wrap in tinfoil on bottom and sides. Leave the skin completely uncovered so the tinfoil forms a tight bath that the juices can collect in and protects the meat from direct heat. Place on a baking tray.
4. Run 1 tsp of oil across the entire skin surface, then sprinkle salt evenly across the entire skin surface - edge to edge. This is critical for the crackling to form.
5. Slow roast in over at 140C for 2.5 hours - with a break at the 1.5 hour point to tighten up the sides of the tinfoil as the meat will have shrunk. Tinfoil should be tight around the sides but not cover the top at all.
6. Take out of over and carefully remove from the tin foil bath - be careful of the hot oils/juices in the bottom.
7. Crank the oven up to 240C
8. Place on an over tray with rack to keep elevated and use balled up tin foil to level up the skin surface. The goal is to make the skin surface as flat as possible to evenly cook the crackling.
9. Put the leveled pork back in the over for 30 minutes - keep an eye on it and re-adjust the levelling as it cooks if required.
10. Rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
