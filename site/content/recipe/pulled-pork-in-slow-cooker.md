Get a large cheap pork roast. This recipe assumes approx 2kg of pork.

If the pork has skin, carefully fillet it off - this can be oiled, generously salted, then baked in oven at 200C until crackling forms all over (Salt is critical to formation of cracking).

In Slow cooker put some Oil (Olive or similar) then place your pork.
Add approx 1cup of stock (whatever you have on hand - chicken works well)
Add 1/2 cup vinegar
Add 1/2 cup barbeque sauce (use tomato if you dont have BBQ sauce)
Add 1/4 cup brown sugar
Add Smoked Paprika (1-2 tbsp) - this adds a smokey flavour
Add Salt and Pepper (You can add more later so just make sure you dont go overboard)
Optional add jalapenos, chilli, garlic, whatever else you like.

Turn SlowCooker on low for 10-12 hours. You can test to see if it will shred easily with 2 forks - If not, keep cooking.

When its finished, turn Slow Cooker off, and using 2 forks shred the entire pork, try to mix things around as well to keep it even.

Spoon onto a fresh bun with coleslaw or in tortilla or whatever you please.
Keeps in fridge for several days or freezer for months.
Reheat in microwave and its as good as when it was fresh.
