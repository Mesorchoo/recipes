## Directions

1. Put all the ingredients for the rissoles, except the oil, in a bowl, take your rings off and, with your hands, mix it all together. Let the mixture sit for a while, if you have time, to allow the flavours to develop, otherwise shape them into patties straightaway.
2. Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan and cook a few of the patties at a time. If you overcrowd the pan they won't cook evenly. Cook the rissoles on a high heat to brown them on both sides, then turn the heat down to medium and cook them for about five minutes on each side to ensure they are cooked through. Place them on paper towels in a low oven to keep them warm.
3. Make the gravy by whisking the flour and the stock in a jug until there are no lumps. Pour it into the pan you cooked the rissoles in, then stir the mixture into the leftover juices and crunchy bits. Stir over a medium heat until the gravy boils and thickens. Add the parsley, then pour over the rissoles.
